## Background
Wines have been interwined with the human cultue since a long time. As time went by the wine industry blossomed. Today, revenue in the Wine segment amounts to US$323,501m in 2020. The market is expected to grow annually by 9.8% (CAGR 2020-2023), as stated by [Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/10030000/100/wine/worldwide). Thus wine reviews have become equally important, people dont want to invest unknowingly. Hence this analysis is done to see the various trends in the reviewed wines and how can a company benefit from them.

## Questions
The questions that I will try to find answers of, are
1. Which are the most reviewed country and most reviewed
variety?
2. Is there any relationship between the price and points
received?
3. What are some characteristics of wine, country-wise?
4. What are some common terms appearing in the lowest-rated
and highest rated wine?
5. Can we create a recommender system?
6. What should a company keep in mind to get good reviews?
7. Is there any relationship between points and any other
attributes?
8. Which variety of grape will be best to make wine?
9. Referring to which reviewer will be beneficial?
10. Should we go with what is familiar or with something less
